# LearnOpenGL
A repo made to learn OpenGL basics.

Graphics programming always has a very steep learning curve. The reason most likely lies in its elusive concepts and lacking efficient ways to debug when problems occur. 

This repo and its demo cases show you some of the most important concenpts envolved in graphics programming step by step. Hopefully, this will shed some light on them.

## OpenGL is DEPRECATED

Well, OpenGL is deprecated from iOS 12. So, why are we wasting our time here studying these simple cases in iOS's domain? 

Yes. OpenGL is now deprecated in iOS. Apple wants all iOS developers to embrace Metal as the most powerfull rendering API on iOS devices and other Apple platforms. And Metal does have lots of edges comparing to OpenGL. But the concepts that stand in our way are shared both in OpenGL and Metal. And from my perspective, understanding there concepts in the OpenGL's realm is relatively easier. That's way OpenGL is discussed here.
